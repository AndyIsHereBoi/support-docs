First off, CGNAT is an abberviation for "Carrier Grade NAT". You may be familar with what NAT is, we explain it in ({{< link "how-port-forwarding-works" >}}). In simple terms, Carrier Grade NAT is simply your ISP doing NAT with a limited pool of IP addreses. There are a fixed number of IP addresses so it's not always possible for each home to have their own IP address.
