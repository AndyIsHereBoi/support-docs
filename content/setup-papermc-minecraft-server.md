PaperMC is a Minecraft Server that lets you run plugins! It's based on Spigot which is based on CraftBukkit, there's a long history :). It's a good Minecraft server choice that balances performance and features.

Let's setup our server!

# Step 1. Download PaperMC
[Click here](https://papermc.io/downloads) to visit the PaperMC Download page. Click the latest build (the build with biggest number) to start the download.

![papermc download]({{< static "post-img/papermc-download-page.png" >}})

# Step 2. Setup run.bat for PaperMC
Move the downloaded `paper-VERSION.jar` file into your minecraft server folder (if you don't have one, just create a new folder called `minecraft-server` somewhere you can easily find). Next, rename the recently downloaded `.jar` file to `paper-server.jar`. This will allow our batch file to work properly.

![rename paper mc file]({{< static "post-img/windows-rename-paper-server.png" >}})

**For Windows** Create a file called `run.bat` and set the contents to

```
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar paper-server.jar nogui
```

If you're not sure how to create a Batch (.bat) file, view {{< link "creating-a-bat-file" >}}.

**For Unix (Linux or MacOS)** Create a new file called `run.sh` and set the contents to 

```
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar paper-server.jar nogui
```

# Step 3. Run run.bat (or run.sh for Unix)

Now double click the newly created `run.bat` file to start the PaperMC server. If this is the first time running the program the folder should now have a handful of new files.

![new files generated by papermc]({{< static "post-img/windows-paper-mc-first-run-new-files.png" >}})

# Step 4. Accept the Eula

Before you can run the Minecraft server you must first accept the Eula. This can be done be editing the `eula.txt` document and setting `eula=false` to `eula=true` and saving the file.

> If the eula.txt file doesn't get created, you might need to install / upgrade Java.

![eula edit]({{< static "post-img/windows-eula-edit.png" >}})
![eula highlight]({{< static "post-img/windows-eula-highlight.png" >}})
![eula true]({{< static "post-img/windows-eula-true.png" >}})

# Step 5. Run run.bat (or run.sh for Unix) again

With the eula now accepted you should be able to run the server again and have it properly launch. If prompted with with a `Windows Security Alert` press `Allow access`.

![defender allow]({{< static "post-img/windows-defender-allow-access.png" >}})

As long as the command line is open, your server should be running. At this point you should try connecting to the server using `127.0.0.1:25565` in Minecraft.

# Step 6. Making the server public with Playit.gg

Your server is now running but people outside of your network / home won't be able to join. Instead of using Port Forwarding or using Hamachi we'll use [playit.gg](https://playit.gg). This is now super easy with our [Minecraft Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playit-gg.105566/).
