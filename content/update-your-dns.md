By default your computer will often be configured to ask your ISP (Internet Service Provider), how to translate a domain name to an IP address. This can sometimes be problematic as many ISPs do not offer all the features which are now standard. This can break Minecraft Java addresses and even cause SSL errors. If you're getting strange errors on the internet, it might be a good idea to try updating your DNS server.
