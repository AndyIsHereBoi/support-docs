PaperMC is a Minecraft server based on Spigot with extra performance improvements. It also supports Spigot Plugins like {{< named-link "add-dynmap-to-minecraft" "dynmap" >}}!

# Step 1. Download PaperMC
[Click here](https://papermc.io/downloads) to visit the PaperMC Download page. Click the latest build (highlighted in red in the below image) to begin the download.

![papermc download]({{< static "post-img/papermc-download-page.png" >}})

# Step 2. Setup run.bat for PaperMC
Move the downloaded `paper-VERSION.jar` file into your minecraft server folder (if you don't have one, just create a new folder called `minecraft-server` somewhere you can easily find). Next, rename the recently downloaded `.jar` file to `paper-server.jar`. This will allow our batch file to work properly.

![rename paper mc file]({{< static "post-img/windows-rename-paper-server.png" >}})

**For Windows** Create a file called `run.bat` and set the contents to

```
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar paper-server.jar nogui
```

If you're not sure how to create a Batch (.bat) file, view {{< link "creating-a-bat-file" >}}.

**For Unix (Linux or MacOS)** Create a new file called `run.sh` and set the contents to 

```
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar paper-server.jar nogui
```

# Step 3. Run run.bat (or run.sh for Unix)

Now double click the newly created `run.bat` file to start the PaperMC server. If this is the first time running the program the folder should now have a handful of new files.

# Step 4. Accept the Eula

Before you can run the Minecraft server you must first accept the Eula. This can be done be editing the `eula.txt` document and setting `eula=false` to `eula=true` and saving the file.


![eula edit]({{< static "post-img/windows-eula-edit.png" >}})
![eula highlight]({{< static "post-img/windows-eula-highlight.png" >}})
![eula true]({{< static "post-img/windows-eula-true.png" >}})

# Step 5. Run run.bat (or run.sh for Unix) again

With the eula now accepted you should be able to run the server again and have it properly launch. If prompted with with a `Windows Security Alert` press `Allow access`.

![defender allow]({{< static "post-img/windows-defender-allow-access.png" >}})

As long as the command line is open, your server should be running. At this point you should try connecting to the server using `127.0.0.1:25565` in Minecraft.


# Step 6. Making the server public with Playit.gg

Now that you have your server running, let's make it public so friends can connect. You can get started by following the guide [found here](https://playit.gg/guides/minecraft).
